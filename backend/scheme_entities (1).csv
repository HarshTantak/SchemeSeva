The target under the scheme was to release 8 Crore LPG Connections to the deprived households by March 2020.
On 7th September 2019, the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India handed over the 8th Crore LPG connection in Aurangabad, Maharashtra.
The release of 8 Crore LPG connections under the scheme has also helped in increasing the LPG coverage from 62% on 1st May 2016 to 99.8% on 1st April 2021.

Snehasparsham,"The Government of Kerala has launched the “Snehasparsham” scheme to protect and help unwed mothers. The problems of unwed mothers are linked with various socio-economic and cultural variables. In Kerala, this problem is coupled with the ignorance and exploitation of the backward classes. It has been pointed out that there are many women in Wayanad and other districts of Kerala who are victims of social exploitation and atrocities and are often forced to become unmarried mothers. Unwed mothers have a special need for education, employment, and health care especially reproductive and child health. Quite often they are neglected from the mainstream of life. The percentage of abortion-related hazards and death is high among teenage unwed mothers.
As a part of this scheme, the Government is giving ₹1000/- per month to them. One curious fact that can be noted is that the women who are exploited never blame the person who caused their misery, largely due to their style of living. At a young age, they long for love and care. Their husbands do not stay with them for long. They go in search of jobs and sometimes do not come back. Their place is taken up by someone else whom these women believe in. Therefore, their condition becomes pathetic and it becomes necessary to address their problems too.","{""AGE"": [""1000/- per month""], ""GENDER"": [], ""LOCATION"": [""Kerala"", ""Wayanad"", ""Kerala""], ""OCCUPATION"": [], ""INCOME"": [], ""SOCIAL_CATEGORY"": [], ""EDUCATION"": [], ""MARITAL_STATUS"": [""unmarried""], ""DISABILITY"": []}"

﻿
Assurance of a remunerative and stable price environment for growers/farmers is very important for increasing agricultural production and productivity. The market price for agricultural produce many times tends to be unstable and volatile which may result into undue losses to the growers and discourage adoption of the modern technology and required inputs.
﻿
The Government’s price policy for agricultural commodities strives to ensure profitable prices to the growers with a vision of encouraging higher investment and production. This leads to safeguarding the consumer interest by making available supplies at reasonable prices with low cost of intermediation. Moreover, the price policy aims at changing a balance and integrated price structure with respect to the overall needs of the economy. Let us take a look at the Price Support Scheme, an initiative taken by the Government to ensure a productive environment for farmers.

Snehapoorvam Scheme,"Kerala Government has launched a noble initiative “Snehapoorvam Scheme” to provide financial assistance to orphans who are living in the family, with their relatives, friends, or the support of the community under the Social Welfare Department implemented through Social Security Mission. The mission has initiated this scheme that aims at bringing these children to the mainstream of society.
The statistics reveal that in Kerala, around 75,000 children below 18 years are living in orphanages. Around 1500 orphanages are functioning in Kerala. Almost 80- 90% of the children in orphanages have families and relatives. Many orphans and vulnerable children slip further into poverty once the family’s main breadwinner stops working or dies. There is nothing more traumatic for a child than to see a parent die. Added to this tragedy is the loss of adult guidance and protection. Children without proper adult care are more likely to be abused & exploited.
Children in this category include orphans, abandoned children, children who have lost their parents in war, communal riots, natural disasters, accidents, etc. They are not properly fed; they have no shelter, nutritious food, health care, education, or any recreation. Most of them are facing economic and social exploitation. They are deprived of the love and affection of the family and are often unwanted by family members.
Objectives of the Scheme:
To identify the orphaned children in the community.
To assess and prioritize children in the greatest need.
To provide social protection to highly vulnerable groups of orphans by strengthening traditional family and community systems for protecting and absorbing orphans.
To improve the basic education, social integration, and nutrition of the most vulnerable groups of orphans towards the levels of other children in the community.
To encourage families to live their children within the family setup rather than sending them to orphanages.
To extend a helping hand to these orphan families by way of providing financial assistance for the education of children.","{""AGE"": [""18 years""], ""GENDER"": [], ""LOCATION"": [""Kerala"", ""Kerala""], ""OCCUPATION"": [], ""INCOME"": [], ""SOCIAL_CATEGORY"": [], ""EDUCATION"": [], ""MARITAL_STATUS"": [], ""DISABILITY"": []}"

Saphalam Scheme For Transgender Students Pursuing Professional Courses,"The “Saphalam Scheme for Transgender Students Pursuing Professional Courses” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala.

Due to a lack of proper education and social stigma in society, the Transgender community is also subjected to severe unemployment. Thus, the Social Justice Department has rolled out this innovative scheme that provides financial assistance to Transgender students pursuing Degree/Diploma level professional courses. This scheme would provide an opening to Transgender students who possess high technical/professional competence.
Those students who have qualified for such professional courses and suffer from financial constraints can continue their education uninterrupted which in turn would increase their employment opportunities and help them to secure a good job and thereby lead a quality life.","{""AGE"": [], ""GENDER"": [], ""LOCATION"": [], ""OCCUPATION"": [""Transgender Students Pursuing Professional Courses""], ""INCOME"": [], ""SOCIAL_CATEGORY"": [], ""EDUCATION"": [], ""MARITAL_STATUS"": [], ""DISABILITY"": []}"

Objectives:
Improve the nutritional status of pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls
Provide a monthly quota of supplementary nutrition to pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls on a fixed day of every month as a take-home ration.

Rainfed Area Development,"Rainfed Area Development (RAD) scheme was launched in 2014-15 to mainstream development of rainfed areas in a sustainable manner. It adopts an area-based approach, focuses on Integrated Farming System (IFS) for enhancing productivity and minimizing risks associated with climatic variability. Under this system, crops/ cropping system is integrated with activities like horticulture, livestock, fishery, agro-forestry, apiculture etc. to enable farmers not only in maximizing farm returns for sustaining livelihood, but also to mitigate the impacts of drought, flood or other extreme weather events with the income opportunity from allied activities during crop damage.
Programmatic interventions as per land capability and conducive to climatic parameters for ensuring integrated development through dissemination and adoption of rainfed technologies with greater reach in disadvantaged areas & location specific planning by way of coordination, convergence and leveraging investments from other Schemes/Missions like MGNREGA, PMKSY-WDC, RKVY, National Food Security Mission(NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), Sub Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE), etc.
It lays emphasis on integrating various components of agriculture such as agriculture, horticulture, fishery, animal husbandry, apiculture, agro forestry, mushrooms, vermi composting, etc. to increase farm production by promoting synergies and reduce impact of adverse climatic conditions. Sustainable agricultural practices such as soil testing based nutrient management, resource conservation, use of indigenous seeds and crop selection based on agro climatic conditions are promoted.
A financial assistance of up to Rs. 30,000/- per family can be given for adoption of integrated farming systems.
A cluster of 100 hectare or more (contiguous or non-contiguous in difficult terrain with close proximity in a village/adjoining villages) may be adopted to derive noticeable impact of convergence and encourage local participation and for future replication of the model in larger areas.
Supplementary support from this component will be admissible for gap-filling resource conservation activities under converging programmes. RAD clusters should have soil analysis/soil health card/soil survey maps to justify the interventions proposed and at least 25% of the farming system area will have to be covered under On Farm Water Management. Farming Systems recommended by ICAR’s Contingency Plans and successful findings of NICRA projects shall also be considered in development of integrated project plan. Besides, creation and development of common property resources/assets/utilities like extensive livestock systems, protective irrigation infrastructure, grain bank, biomass shredders, fodder bank, group marketing etc. will be encouraged under this component.
The key objectives of the Mission are as follows:
•	To undertake location specific and landscape-based approach to dry-land areas to ensure natural resources conservation and sustainable use, strengthening of agriculture production systems and livelihood development through integration/convergence of schemes in an area-based approach.
•	To make agriculture more productive, sustainable, remunerative and climate resilient by promoting location specific Integrated/Composite Farming Systems.
•	To conserve natural resources through appropriate soil and moisture conservation measures.
•	To develop capacity of farmers and stakeholders in conjunction with other ongoing Missions such as National Food and Nutrition Security Mission, National Initiative for Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) etc., in the domain of climate change adaptation measures.
•	To improve the productivity of rainfed farming by mainstreaming rainfed technologies refined under All India Coordinated Research Project on Dry land Agriculture (AICRPDA-NICRA) and by leveraging resources/provisions made under other Schemes/Missions like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), PMKSY-WDC, NFNSM, RKVY, Krishonnati Yojana, SMAE, National Mission on Natural Farming etc.","{""AGE"": [""2014-15""], ""GENDER"": [], ""LOCATION"": [], ""OCCUPATION"": [], ""INCOME"": [], ""SOCIAL_CATEGORY"": [], ""EDUCATION"": [], ""MARITAL_STATUS"": [], ""DISABILITY"": []}"

Kanyashree Prakalpa,"Kanyashree Prakalpa seeks to improve the status and well-being of girls, specifically those from socio-economically disadvantaged families through Conditional Cash Transfers by:
﻿
Incentivizing them to continue in education for a longer period, and complete secondary or higher secondary education, or equivalent in technical or vocational steams, thereby giving them a better footing in both the economic and social spheres.
﻿
Disincentivizing marriage till at least the age of 18, the legal age of marriage, thereby reducing the risks of early pregnancies, associated risks of maternal and child mortality, and other debilitating health conditions, including that malnutrition.
﻿
It was also decided that the Scheme should confer more than just monetary support; it should be a means of financial inclusion and a tool of empowerment for adolescent girls. The scheme's benefits are therefore paid directly to bank accounts in the girls' names, leaving the decision of utilizing the money in their hands.
﻿
To reinforce the positive impact of increased education and delayed marriages, the scheme also works to enhance the social power and self-esteem of girls through a targeted behavior change communication strategy. The communication strategy not only builds awareness of the scheme, but includes adolescent-friendly approaches like events, competitions, and Kanyashree clubs, and the endorsement of strong women figures as role models to promote social and psychological empowerment.
﻿
As more and more girls remain in school, it is envisaged that they will use the opportunity to gain skills and knowledge to help them become economically independent. Even if girls do get married soon after they turn 18, it is expected that their education and enhanced social and emotional development will give them a better foundation for their adult lives. And over time, as entire generations of women enter marriages only after they have some degree of economic independence, it is expected that the practice of child marriage will be completely eradicated. Women will attain their right to health, education, and socio-economic equality.
﻿
The main objective of the scheme is to prevent child marriage and promote education among girls. It also aims to improve the health and nutrition of girls and empower them by building their skills and capacities.
﻿
The scheme is implemented through a network of school teachers, community workers, and government officials. The scheme has been recognized as a best practice in girl-child empowerment by the United Nations.
﻿
Overall, the Kanyashree Prakalpa scheme has been successful in promoting the education and well-being of girls in West Bengal and has been replicated in other parts of the country.","{""AGE"": [""18""], ""GENDER"": [], ""LOCATION"": [""West Bengal""], ""OCCUPATION"": [], ""INCOME"": [], ""SOCIAL_CATEGORY"": [], ""EDUCATION"": [], ""MARITAL_STATUS"": [""married""], ""DISABILITY"": []}"

Chief Minister Floriculture Mission,"Prevalence of suitable agro climate has led to natural occurrence of a large number of flowering species in Assam having aesthetic value and horticultural importance. Existence of an ornamental garden is a tradition and characteristic feature of every household in Assam. From time immemorial, the State has been endowed with a rich diversity of flowering annuals and perennials, bulbous ornamental, amazing creepers, ferns and foliage and awesome orchids. In orchid alone, Assam is credited with the natural occurrence of 191 splendid species having diversified forms and wide colour range. Contrary to the potential and scope of commercialization, the State floriculture even till today, is largely confined to household garden as a part of hobby horticulture. The number of commercial pockets can be counted on fingers. Although, the State floriculture sector has shown some amount of growth under the impact of government sponsored development projects like HMNEH, the net position of the State in the National Floriculture Map is yet to be visible. Today, Assam registers an area of 1800 ha under total floriculture which is less than 1% of the total area under floriculture in the country and 7.8% of the total area under floriculture in the neighboring West Bengal.
﻿
It is further observed that even the neighboring states like West Bengal has a pride position in terms of area and production of flower crops eventually finding its way to the markets in Assam. Today, the incoming flower basket from West Bengal has virtually captured the State's flower market primarily due to low internal production and lack of consistency in supply as per desired volumes. According to unofficial estimates, the annual inflow of flowers to the State's flower market hovers around Rs. 7-8 crores paving out outflow of State's revenue in substantial quantum.
It is now well accepted that in order to sustain agriculture as a profitable venture, due attention must be paid to selection of high value crop options that fetch higher return on investment per unit area. It has been an established fact that as a potential component of horticultural sector, the floriculture based enterprises can provide significantly higher net return to farmers compared to other agricultural production options due to their higher market prices resulting from uniqueness, diversified uses and fascination on part of higher income group.

Swasraya Scheme For Parents/Mothers Of Physically Handicapped/Mentally Retarded Persons,"The scheme “Swasraya Scheme for Parents/Mothers of Physically Handicapped/Mentally Retarded Persons” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. Under the scheme, financial assistance is provided to women of Below Poverty Line (BPL) families to find self-employment, whose husbands have died/abandoned, and who have to take care of their sons/children with severe physical and mental challenges.
Parents of severely mentally retarded and differently-abled persons require emotional strength and flexibility. Older parents can find themselves overwhelmed by various medical, caregiving, and financial responsibilities. Physically Handicapped/Mentally Retarded (PH/MR) persons always need special care and attention since they cannot perform their day-to-day activities without someone else’s assistance. Sometimes it can be quite challenging for older parents in BPL families, especially mothers, who have to take care of household tasks and work apart from taking care of MR persons.
Looking after such a Mentally challenged/PH person is expensive. These expenses can arise from medical equipment and supplies, medical care, caregiving expenses, specialized transportation, etc. Even though an amount of ₹600/- is being provided as “Aswasakiranam Pension” to caregivers (family members) of bedridden PH/MR persons, it cannot cover the expenses completely. Single mothers face tremendous challenges. Often, a custodial parent must fulfill the roles of primary provider and caregiver without the benefit of a partner. It is a difficult task under the best of circumstances.","{""AGE"": [], ""GENDER"": [""Physically Handicapped/Mentally Retarded""], ""LOCATION"": [""MR""], ""OCCUPATION"": [], ""INCOME"": [""600/-""], ""SOCIAL_CATEGORY"": [], ""EDUCATION"": [], ""MARITAL_STATUS"": [""Single""], ""DISABILITY"": [""Handicapped"", ""Handicapped""]}"

Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yozana - Assam,"Agriculture occupies the primary position in the economy of the state of Assam. Over 70% of the state’s population relies on agriculture as farmers, as agricultural labourers, or both for their livelihood. Although agriculture in Assam is characterized by stagnation, low productivity and frequent occurrence of floods, and low levels of public and private investment. The small and fragmented land holdings and frequent floods in the state are a causative factor for farmers to have lower income and agricultural activities become non-remunerative in the State. To boost agricultural productivity, it is pertinent to make interventions through financial assistance to poor farmers. Hence, the finance minister of Assam had announced to assist the farmers to promote the use of scientific farm implements. To encourage the farmer to procure and use such implements, the Department of Agriculture proposed a scheme “Mukhya Mantri Sa Sajuli Yojana” (Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme) for the purpose and launched in FY 2018-19.
The scheme “Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana” is a State Owned Priority Development (SOPD) scheme and the main purpose of launching this scheme for farmers is their holistic development by implementing several farm mechanization schemes. With the help of “Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana” the government aims to increase farm productivity in the limited land to meet the expanding demand for farm produce and ensure higher income for farmers. As of now, the usage of scientific tools in cultivation is very limited in the state of Assam. So, the state govt. of Assam is making every possible effort through Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme to ensure the economic growth of rural farmers. Under this scheme, the following is proposed:
1.	₹ 5000/- will be provided to each farmer
2.	The number of beneficiaries will be a total of 5 lakh farmers.
3.	The assistance is to procure farm tools/farm implements.
4.	Scheme will be implemented on Direct Benefit Transfer by electronic transfer into the accounts of the beneficiaries.
5.	The Selection of beneficiaries will be done by the District Level Committee headed by the Deputy Commissioner of the District. The Principal Secretaries will chair the DLC in the case of BTAD and Autonomous Districts.
6.	The Scheme will be implemented under the overall supervision of the State-Level Monitoring Committee chaired by the Agriculture Production Commissioner.

The three components of the scheme are as under:
1.	Sour Badhbandi (Solar Fencing):
Monkey and wildlife menace causes huge losses to crops annually in the State. The present practice of crop protection by manual guarding did not ensure 100 percent crop protection. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana” in the name of Solar Fencing. Under this scheme, a subsidy of 85% is being provided if three or more farmers opt to install solar fencing, and if farmers opt to install solar fencing on individual land then an 80% subsidy is being provided. The fence is energized with the help of solar power. Current fences around the farms will be sufficient to keep away stray animals, wild animals, and monkeys from the farms.
2.	Anti-Hail Net Structure:
Hailstorms in Himachal Pradesh are one of the major natural calamities resulting in substantial economic loss to the farmers by damaging standing vegetable crops both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In order to mitigate the losses caused by hail storms the new scheme “Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana (Anti-Hail Net Structure)” was started by the State Government in 2020-21 and implemented through the Department of Agriculture. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojna” in the name of Anti Hail Nets. The schemes will primarily benefit farmers helping them to substantially, reduce the quantitative and qualitative losses to their vegetable produce. Financial assistance maximum of up to 80% is being provided to the eligible farmer for an area coverage maximum of up to 5000 sqm. The monetary gains are expected to be approximately 15-20 crores annually with significant contributions to the state GDP.
3.	Green House Renovation Scheme:
Farmers of the state have demanded that there should be a scheme to replace the Poly sheets. Therefore, the Government of Himachal Pradesh introduced a scheme “Mukhya Mantri Green House Renovation Scheme” in the year 2017-18. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana” as a component namely Green House Renovation.

Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission,"Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is the flagship program of the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) for promoting poverty reduction through building strong institutions for the poor, particularly women, and enabling these institutions to access a range of financial services and livelihoods. DAY-NRLM adopts a demand-driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State-specific poverty reduction action plans. The blocks and districts in which all the components of DAY-NRLM would be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs, would be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas the remaining would be non-intensive blocks and districts. National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a restructured version of restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016.
﻿
NRLM has set out with an agenda to cover 7 Crore rural poor households, across 600 districts, 6000 blocks, 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats and 6 lakh villages in the country through self-managed Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated institutions and support them for livelihoods collectives in a period of 8-10 years. In addition, the poor would be facilitated to achieve increased access to their rights, entitlements, and public services, diversified risk, and better social indicators of empowerment. NRLM believes in harnessing the innate capabilities of the poor and complements them with capacities (information, knowledge, skills, tools, finance, and collectivization) to participate in the growing economy of the country.
﻿
The Mission
""To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong grassroots institutions of the poor.""
﻿
The Core Values
Inclusion of the poorest, and meaningful role to the poorest in all the processes
Transparency and accountability of all processes and institutions
Ownership and the key role of the poor and their institutions in all stages – planning, implementation, and, monitoring
Community self-reliance and self-dependence
﻿
NRLM implementation is in a Mission Mode. This enables -
(a) the shift from the present allocation-based strategy to a demand-driven strategy enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans,
(b) focus on targets, outcomes, and time-bound delivery,
(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector, and
(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes.
﻿
As NRLM follows a demand-driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios.","{""AGE"": [""March 29, 2016"", ""8-10 years""], ""GENDER"": [], ""LOCATION"": [""States""], ""OCCUPATION"": [], ""INCOME"": [], ""SOCIAL_CATEGORY"": [], ""EDUCATION"": [], ""MARITAL_STATUS"": [], ""DISABILITY"": []}"

Aswasakiranam,"Detailed
Kerala is a state well known for its efficient and effective health care system. Despite these advancements, much headway could not be made in-home care. Most of the lowest income group always opt for homely treatment as they cannot afford the charges levied by the well-known hospitals. They are bedridden causing a heavy social burden on their family members who are forced to stay back at home to look after these bedridden patients. While the upper-income group can possibly afford to engage paid caregivers or home nurses for looking after such bedridden family members, the lower-income group usually take it upon themselves to care for their bedridden brethren. These family members in fact function as informal caregivers, without due recognition or economic gain.
﻿
Coverage Of Diseases
●	All bed-ridden patients who need a full-time caregiver.

Financial Aid For Providing Hostel Facility To Transgender Students,"The scheme “Financial Aid for Providing Hostel Facility to Transgender Students” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. Transgender share the same hopes and dreams as any other individual in our society. 58% of Transgender students drop out before completing 10th grade (24% of Transgender students drop out even before completion of 9th grade). Reasons for this include- severe harassment making studies impossible and other gender-related negative experiences at school. In order to help such school dropouts continue their education, Social Justice Department has implemented a scholarship scheme for Transgender.
The transgender community is still ostracized in society and cannot take up job offers or continue their education due to a lack of accommodation facilities. Though there has been improvement in the mindset of the people, still the stigma of giving transgender persons a house exists in society. Due to this problematic scenario, transgender who are pursuing the scholarship scheme are forced to discontinue their studies. For addressing this issue, the Department of Social Justice has introduced this scheme that provides an amount of ₹4,000/- per month as financial assistance to the Transgender community as rent for finding hostel facilities/accommodation.","{""AGE"": [], ""GENDER"": [], ""LOCATION"": [], ""OCCUPATION"": [""Transgender Students""], ""INCOME"": [""4,000/-""], ""SOCIAL_CATEGORY"": [], ""EDUCATION"": [], ""MARITAL_STATUS"": [], ""DISABILITY"": []}"

Dalit Bandhu,"The Dalit Bandhu Scheme is a unique initiative launched by the government of Telangana to promote the economic development of families belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) community. The scheme provides financial assistance of Rs. 10 lakhs to eligible SC families to start their own businesses or entrepreneurial ventures, thereby creating opportunities for them to become self-reliant and improve their standard of living.
﻿
As a part of a multi-pronged approach, in addition to existing entitlements like food security, education, and social security, a different strategy with a new initiative ""Telangana Dalit Bandhu"" is introduced to intensify the level of financial assistance to SC households for the establishment of suitable income generating economic support schemes as the delivery of credit by banks in the form of loans has become a constraint.
﻿
Under the scheme, eligible families will receive financial assistance of Rs. 10 lakhs each, in the form of a grant, to start a small business or entrepreneurial venture. The scheme is expected to benefit over 20 lakh families in the state over the next few years. One-time capital assistance of Rs.10 lakhs per SC family is provided for all SC families as a 100% grant/subsidy to establish suitable income-generating schemes as per their choice (without bank loan linkage).
﻿
The main objective of the scheme is to reduce poverty and promote entrepreneurship among the SC community, which has historically been marginalized and faced discrimination in society. The scheme is also expected to promote inclusive growth and social development in the state.
﻿
The Telangana government has allocated Rs. 1,000 crores for the implementation of the scheme in the first year. The scheme is expected to be implemented in a phased manner, with eligible families being identified and selected based on a set of criteria such as income level, educational qualification, and entrepreneurial skills.
﻿
Overall, the Dalit Bandhu Scheme is a path-breaking initiative that aims to uplift the socio-economic status of the SC community in Telangana. The scheme provides a much-needed boost to entrepreneurship and economic development among the marginalized sections of society, thereby promoting inclusive growth and social development in the state.","{""AGE"": [], ""GENDER"": [], ""LOCATION"": [""Telangana"", ""Telangana"", ""Telangana""], ""OCCUPATION"": [], ""INCOME"": [], ""SOCIAL_CATEGORY"": [""Scheduled Caste"", ""SC"", ""SC"", ""SC"", ""SC"", ""SC"", ""SC"", ""SC""], ""EDUCATION"": [], ""MARITAL_STATUS"": [], ""DISABILITY"": []}"
